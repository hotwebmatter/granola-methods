# granola-methods

Eighth programming exercise in chapter three

Note that "Bars Sold" is a double-precision float,
formatted to show two decimal places of value. (I
did this, even though it looks a bit like dollars
and cents, because I wanted the solution to allow
selling partial cases of granola bars.)

## Example output
```
$ dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/granola-methods.dll
Enter cases sold: 100
Enter price per bar: 1
